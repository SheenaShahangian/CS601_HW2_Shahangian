# Read Me - MET CS 601 Sheena Shahangian

This iteration of my website contains the HTML for 4 pages all styled using CSS. The homepage is the filename "index.html". I have placed stylesheets in the css directory, and all photos within the "multimedia" directory. Please see below for a description of where I have included the requested elements (and where I have provided extras).

## Requested Elements



### Incorporation of Other Additional Elements Presented During Class - How I Went Above and Beyond

I've attempted to add some new features beyond the standard requirements listed in the rubric. These include: 

* using Google Fonts rather than system fonts to give my website an elevated and customized look (while still ensuring fallback fonts are chosen)

* having more than one property:value pair on nearly every selector I've used

* organizing my css document with comments to ensure the design choices are clear and easy to find (which will make this website easier to modify in the future)

* creating a color palette that I have based my styles on to ensure consistency in brand
